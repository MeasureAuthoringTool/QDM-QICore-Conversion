    <definitions>Participation: The identifiers and descriptors for each organization’s coverage used to define
        members’ eligibility for measure reporting. Allocation for reporting is based on eligibility during the
        Participation Period.

        Participation Period: The Measurement Period.
    </definitions>
    <guidance>HEDIS ECDS technical specifications include both narrative specification language and expression of
        the measure logic in Clinical Quality Language (CQL)-based Health Quality Measure Format (HQMF), Release 1.
        At this time the measure logic is provided as a reference, complementing the narrative measure calculation.

        Allocation: The member was enrolled with a medical benefit throughout the participation period.

        Requirements: The composite is based on a model that looks at the number of immunizations that were
        administered or contraindicated due to history of anaphylactic reaction or encephalopathy following
        vaccination (numerator) out of the possible number of immunizations needed to be administered to members,
        per clinical guideline recommendations for the age group (denominator).

        For commercial and Medicaid plan members 19–65 years of age, Denominator 5 is determined by summing
        Denominators 1–3. Numerator 5 is determined by summing Numerators 1–3.

        For Medicare plan members 66 years of age and older, Denominator 5 is determined by summing Denominators
        1–4. Numerator 5 is determined by summing Numerators 1–4.
